### About

The Public Buildings Reform Board (PBRB) was established under P.L. 114-287, the Federal Assets Sale & Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA), as an independent agency to identify opportunities for the Federal government to significantly reduce its inventory of civilian real property and thereby reduce costs. Sworn into service in May 2019, the Board is well underway in delivering its first set of recommendations required within 180 days of their appointment. 


### FASTA

The Federal Assets Sale & Transfer Act of 2016, commonly referred to as FASTA, outlines the Board's roles and responsibilities for  identifying underutilized Federal real property. 

##### Identify High Value Assets (HVAs)
The Board used a variety of sources to identify underutilized HVAs to include:
- Federal Real Property Database
- Recommendations from Agencies
- Recommendations from public forums
     
#### Recommend High Value Assets (HVAs) for Disposal 
No later than 180 days after appointment, the Board must recommend high value, underutilized real property assets and recommend them for  disposal. The list of properties recommended for disposal must meet the following criteria:
- No less than five properties recommended for disposal 
- Total fair market value of all recommended properties shall be no less than $500M and no more than $750M
- None of the existing improvements on properties sold under this subsection may be leased back to the Government
- All properites must be sold within a year of the acceptance of the Report of Excess, unless it is in the financial interest of the Government to execute the sale more than a year after the acceptance of the Report of Excess, but not greater than 2 years
